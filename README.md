## Project Motivation
This project you will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. The data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform.

</br>Though the above dashboard is just showing the newest articles, you could imagine having a recommendation board available here that shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, you will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. You can create your own account to become a part of their community, and get a better understanding of their data by creating an account on the platform here(https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/login).

## Porject Descriptions 
There are four components in this project. </br>

**I. Exploratory Data Analysis**</br>
**II. Rank Based Recommendations** </br>
To get started in building recommendations, First find the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions. Since there are no ratings for any of the articles, it is easy to assume the articles with the most interactions are the most popular. These are then the articles might recommend to new users (or anyone depending on what we know about them). </br>

**III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering**</br>
In order to build better recommendations for the users of IBM's platform, I could look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users. This would be a step in the right direction towards more personal recommendations for the users.

**IV. Matrix Factorization** </br>



**V. Extras & Concluding** </br>
